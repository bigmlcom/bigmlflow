BigMLFlow
==========

All the resources generated by the `BigML` API-first platform, including
models, are totally white-box, and they can be downloaded as JSON and used
to predict anywhere.

On the other hand, MLFlow offers tracking and deploying capacities for a
variety of ML models as long a `flavor` is created to define how to log, save
and load those models to be actionable.

The `bigmlflow` library implements this flavor. It uses
`BigML's Python bindings <https://bigml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/local_resources.html>`_
to integrate the BigML models with `MLFlow's` tracking and deploying capacities.

The flavor is implemented in a single ``bigmlflow`` module

BigMLFlow usage
---------------

The `examples <../../../examples/README.md>`_ folder shows a few use cases
that cover some of the Supervised Models available in BigML and
a full training example to demo the logging and tracking of `BigML's models`
using `MLFlow`.
